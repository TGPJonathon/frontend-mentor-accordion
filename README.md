## Overview

Fourth challenge done after a two month break. I'm feeling very good about my developing CSS skills. I ran into only one issue with this one that I didn't figure out. I wanted the accordion
to take up the max-width of 600px, but it seems unless the content
needs the space I could only get to 535px. Was unsure of how to
set the width to take up all the space, while remaining responsive.
